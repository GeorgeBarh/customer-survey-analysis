# Customer Survey Analysis

The Customer Survey Analysis Program is a Python-based application designed to handle, analyze, and report on customer feedback. This project integrates Google Sheets for data storage and employs various Python modules to manage user interactions, process survey responses, and generate insightful reports. Users can interact with the application as either a Customer or Owner. Customers provide feedback through a survey, while owners analyze the collected data and generate reports.

You can access the live version of the application [here](https://customer-survey-analysis-f7747660b229.herokuapp.com/).
